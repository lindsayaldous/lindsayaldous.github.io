      <h3>Problem Statement (v. 2.0)</h3>
      <h5>Ideal</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Residents surrounding Lake Simcoe are concerned about the general 
          health of the lake. Our team will investigate changes in levels of biomass in Lake 
          Simcoe for 2008 and 2013 to gauge the health of the lake.
      </p>
      <h5>Reality</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">As far as we're aware, there's currently no web-based system in 
          place that displays biomass data over time, so interested parties are lacking a 
          consistent, shared source of information.
      </p>
      <h5>Consequences</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Lack of information of general lake health indicated by biomass 
          does not provide opportunities to identify areas of concern or promote conservation 
          efforts.
      </p>
        <h5>Proposal</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Implement a map-centric web app that displays biomass data for 
          Lake Simcoe in an accessible manner.
      </p>
      <h5>Technology</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">ArcGIS Technology (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Online)

      <h4>Project Planning Phase</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we did: </b>
      We began by forming our problem statement, which can be seen above. First, we defined our ideal outcome of this project from a user's 
      perspective. Next, we stated the current reality that exists for its potential users and the consequences should this continue to be the 
      reality. Finally, we drafted a proposal briefly outlining our tentative solution to the problem, and the technology we would use to achieve it.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we learned: </b>
      The first draft of our problem statement ended up being too all-encompassing for the scope of this project. We amended this by choosing 
      to focus only on Geocortex 5 Web and ArcGIS Online. Our problem statement also focused too much on how it would benefit us, so we 
      redirected the wording to really hone in on how the user would benefit from the creation of our project.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Results: </b>
      We had a specific and actionable problem statement to guide us for the rest of the project. We could return to it if we needed to 
      remind ourselves of the scope and intent of what we were trying to do.
      </p><br>
    
      <h4>Discovery and Experimentation Phase</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we did: </b>
      We spent this phase individually familiarizing ourselves with Geocortex 5 Web. We would share what we discovered with each other during 
      our meetings. After some time experimenting with Geocortex on our own, we came together to explore some functions more related to our project.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we learned: </b>
      The first thing we learned about Geocortex 5 Web is that it can actually be accessed from inside ArcGIS Online. This was a bit different from 
      what we learned with Geocortex Essentials in class. We also encountered an unfortunate bug present in the version of Geocortex 5 Web provided 
      by the school: when trying to edit a new Map component, a Loading Error occurs. As such, this means only one map component can be added 
      to a layout. In addition, when adding a new layout, you MUST select "Copy current layout" because a blank layout will not be able to have 
      a new functioning Map component added to it. The only workaround for this problem right now is to edit the Map component that is already present.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Results: </b>
      We developed a greater understanding of the functionality of Geocortex 5 Web, how it is used along with ArcGIS Online, and some of the 
      issues we may encounter while creating our final product.
      </p><br> 

      <h4>Data Preparation Phase</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we did: </b>
      A dataset containing the polygon boundaries of the upper-tier, lower-tier, and single-tier municipalities of Ontario was brought into 
      ArcGIS Pro and joined with an Excel file containing the URLs of the official websites of the municipalities. This data was then uploaded 
      to ArcGIS Online, where it was accessible to be referenced in a Geocortex 5 Web app.
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Results: </b>
      We were then ready to proceed to create our final product.
      </p><br>

      <h4>Development Phase</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we did: </b>
      We started by switching out the default 2D map for our map by linking it from ArcGIS Online. We also removed the default 3D map. Next, 
      we customized many of the map components such as the Home tab, the Toolbar, and the Map surround elements. We also customized which fields 
      are viewable to the map user, the only necessary two being the name of the municipality, and the URL to its website. Finally, the app was 
      published by saving it, and then selecting "Deploy", and "Push to Production".
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we learned: </b>
      What we noted very quickly is that all edits to the actual map must be performed in ArcGIS Online, such as the symbolization of the 
      layers, the viewable fields, and the default active layers. This was unexpected for us, as we initially had the impression that most of 
      our work would be completed in Geocortex. We also discovered that Geocortex does not automatically save your work, it must be manually 
      saved before you leave the page. we also encountered difficulty with using a custom image on the app. Images must be sized exactly to 
      the dimensions of the app, or else they will not display properly, and they must be hosted on a publicly viewable site. Uploading our 
      images to the Geocortex editor directly did not appear to work. Lastly, when publishing our application, we discovered that you can easily 
      un-publish your app by setting the Sharing Permissions to "Not Shared" in the Deploy menu and selecting the Production menu. 
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Results: </b>
      A successfully created beta version of our app, ready to be reviewed with Shawn.
      </p><br>

      <h4>Review Phase</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>What we did: </b>
      We provided Shawn with a link to our Geocortex 5 Web application, which he explored and provided us with feedback. We were able to view 
      this process as a viewer of Shawn's screen. 
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Results: </b>
      It was helpful to watch someone else interact with our product as a potential end user. It provided us with much insight to finalize 
      our design. We took Shawn's suggestions and made appropriate slight changes to the final product. You can see our solution in action below!
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><b>Future suggestions: </b>
      To improve our product in the future, it would be helpful to also include the URLs to the upper-tier municipalities. Due to time constraints, 
      this was not possible for us because we could not find a CSV or Excel document containing that information. It would also be helpful to develop 
      a filter or similar system in Geocortex that would only show municipalities that have a website, as some do not, and their Website field is left blank as a result.

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64" id="solution">
    <h1 class="w3-center">Solution</h1><br>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">To solve the problem at hand, an interactive map was developed using Geocortex 5 that displays all lower and upper tier 
      municipalities in Ontario for the public to explore. Users can explore their boundaries and will have access to all their 
      official names and websites just by clicking on the area of interest.</p>
    <a class="w3-text-blue-grey w3-large" href="https://luna.flemingcollege.ca/Geocortex/WebViewer/?app=642cbce9691e4f979ec72ce1550d136e">Upper and Lower Tier Municipalities of Ontario</a>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Click the link above to view the final product.<i> The link will be inactive beyond April 30, 2021.</i> The image below is what the users will first see when they access the web map.</p>
    <img src="images/Home.jpg" class="w3-image w3-border-black" alt="Menu" style="width:100%">
    <h5>Tabs</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">The column on the left side of the web page shows three tabs labelled Home, Layers, and Legend. The home tab describes what 
      users will be able to do with the features to view the municipalities. The layer tab shows the two layers called Lower 
      Boundary and Upper Boundary that can be turned on or off to display them on the map.  The third tab is the legend which shows
       which polygons belong to each layer. The upper boundary municipalities are coloured yellow and the lower boundary 
       municipalities are blue.</p>
    <h5>Search Bar</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Users can use the search bar to enter keywords to locate areas of interest and are provided with a 
      list of results relating to the search. When the user clicks on one of these results, they are provided with the option to 
      view the location with the World Geocoder for ArcGIS or with the Lower or Upper Boundary layers if applicable. For the example of 
      Gravenhurst, the selectable layers based on this search are the World Geocoder for ArcGIS and the Lower Boundary layer.</p>
    <h5>Toolbar</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">The toolbar provides the users with the opportunity to draw points, lines or polygons on the map and 
      then clear those markups with the click of a button. There is also a measure tool that allows the user to measure lengths 
      across the map or measure any given area. The fourth option on the toolbar is the identify tool that allows the user to 
      pinpoint a location on the map and results for municipalities in that area appear in a list. The list shows both municipality 
      tier layers and has the options for users to click on a feature of interest and have it attributes appear in the side column. 
      The last option in the toolbar is the ability to print the map at a scale determined by the user. With the I want to menu, 
      users are able to return to the initial map position and zoom level and also switch the colour theme to dark depending on the 
      user's preference.</p>
      <h5>Widgets</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">In the bottom right corner of the web page there are two widgets that help users customize the map. 
        The button on the left allows the user to choose a new basemap from a provided list. The button on the right allows users 
        to create bookmarks of an area and give it a name. With these bookmarks, the users are able to quickly return to that view 
        and continue exploring. In the top left corner of the map under the I want to menu, there is another widget that allows the 
        user to zoom in and out on the map. This can also be accomplished by scrolling with the mouse.</p>
